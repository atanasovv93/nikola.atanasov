            <h2>Our History</h2>
            <p>The Bee's Protection Agency was founded in 2020 by a group of passionate environmentalists who recognized the critical role bees play in our world. Since then, we have grown into a leading organization in bee conservation.</p>
            <h2>Our Team</h2>
            <p>Our team is made up of dedicated professionals and volunteers who are committed to making a difference for bees and the environment. We are scientists, educators, and advocates working together to create a better future for bees.</p>
            <br />
            <h2>Why Bees Matter</h2>
            <p>Bees are critical for pollinating plants and crops. They contribute to one-third of the food we consume, including fruits, vegetables, and nuts. Without bees, our food supply would be significantly affected, leading to food scarcity and higher prices.</p>

            <p>We actively participate in and promote various conservation projects aimed at protecting bee habitats.
